First we need to define a main function and creat an empty list to put every data into it. Then we set the accumulators
to count for the line and key value of the data files. And then we need to create some for loops to add the number of
keys of the three files together and the total distance of the three files together. Define another function in order to
sort out the maximum value and the minimum value in the files. Lastly, I create another list for those participants have
multiple records. And output and print everything.
