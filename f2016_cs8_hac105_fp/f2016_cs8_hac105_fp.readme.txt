First we need to start a class definition and set the properties of name and distance.
Then we use the initializer method and then we use the addDistance method to add all the distance together, and we
need to get a for loop in this function to iterate the distance so the data will be added.
Use getName function to return the name of the participants. Ans getDistance, and getRuns function to return the
value. Then we use len() to get the total participants and those people who have multiple records. And we use
min and max to find the minimum and maximum value in the files. Finally we set the string in the right format and
create an output file in the end.

PS: when I run the program, I typed in the data text file which contains the three names of the three
cvs data files. But it can not be read in pycharm. So when I try to run on idle, it works. So i decided to
change the data text file with the three path ways of the three cvs data files. So when you run my program
please copy the path way of the data txt file.
